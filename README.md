# MonospaceTypewriterDZ

MonospaceTypewriterDZ is [Manfred Klein](http://luc.devroye.org/klein.html)'s fantastic [MonospaceTypewriter](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/MonospaceTypewriter) font modified for programming usage. The original font does not distinguish betweeen 0 and O, so a dot has been added to 0, hence the name DZ(Dotted Zero)

MonospaceTypewriter provides good readability while being a rather slender typeface. It has a “retro” personality but not too much to be a distraction.
